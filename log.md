# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked repo for the 100DaysOfCode Challenge. Set up GitHub, learnt GitHub.

**Thoughts:** After having a GitHub account for awhile now, i have never actually used it, so the 100DaysOfCode is already working by making me get to grips with GitHub.
