# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked repo for the 100DaysOfCode Challenge. Set up GitHub, learnt GitHub.

**Thoughts:** After having a GitHub account for awhile now, i have never actually used it, so the 100DaysOfCode is already working by making me get to grips with GitHub.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a fixed nav bar on my portfolio website. Looking into a single page layout.

**Thoughts:** Using bootstrap has made the creation process simpler. The actual day 1 was missed due to a party. It feels good to be working on personal projects.
